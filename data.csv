To improve it, the machine learning model could be trained with more diverse data, and a quick feedback option for users can help make the system smarter over time.","Students and faculty can be encouraged to use eTapon more effectively through awareness campaigns, clear instructions near the bin, and incentives like rewards for consistent proper use. Regular demonstrations and integrating the system into environmental programs can also boost engagement.
